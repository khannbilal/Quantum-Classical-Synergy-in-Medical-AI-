Pulmonary nodule classification is hindered by CT variability, noisy labels, &amp; class imbalance. We compare classical, and hybrid quantum–classical (HQC) models for volumetric CT. HQC with variational circuits outperforms CNN and transformer baselines (ROC-AUC 0.89±0.02), recall (0.86±0.03), showing improved robustness in data-limited settings.
